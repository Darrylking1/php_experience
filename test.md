1. The following is the array of the number of zeepay to mtn transactions we recorded each day of the month June.

[834,1012, 83, 121, 343,57,83,902, 45,232,12,575,883,231,41,100,1000,343,1211,35,788,996,323,12,57,721,89,234,778,144]

Each element is the number of transactions for each day of the month.

Write a function, so that when i pass in this array, I get the sums of transactions for each day of the week for the whole month.

For example

[
    "monday" => 123, "tuesday" => 9900, "wednesday" => 431, "thursday" => 889, "friday" => 9203, "saturday"=> 9923, "sunday" => 90302
